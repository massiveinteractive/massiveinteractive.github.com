On the design front, our UX&D leaders believe that good user interfaces - which are best arrived at through rigorous discovery processes and analysis - sell more content. Bad or average ones sell less. If you’re in the business of commercialising video content, it pays to get it right.\r\n\r\nFor more 15 years we have worked closely with television networks and channels, cable TV operators, online video operators, film distributors, telcos and airlines – learning about their businesses and collaborating with them to create innovative new entertainment services for their customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Open Source Initiatives\r\n\r\nMassive provide a number of open source libraries and tools that are intended to increase the quality, efficiency and consistency of **cross-platform** development with **Haxe**.\r\n\r\n* **munit** - unit testing framework and CLI\r\n* **mcover** - code coverage framework\r\n* **msignal** - type safe port of Robert Penner’s AS3 Signals leveraging Haxe generics.\r\n* **minject** - macro enhanced Haxe port of Till Schneidereit's AS3 Swift Suspenders ...\r\n* **mmvc** - Haxe port of RobotLegs minus events plus signals.\r\n* **mcover** -  console and logging API for Haxe\r\n* **mpartial** - macro library for implementing platform specific functionality as partial-classes in Haxe.\r\n\r\nSee <https://github.com/massiveinteractive> for more information.\r\n \r\n#### What is Haxe?\r\n\r\nHaxe is an multi-platform open source programming language (<http://www.haxe.org>).\r\n\r\n* Designed for platform agnostic and cross platform development\r\n* Compiles to JavaScript, Flash, C++, Java, C# and more\r\n* Open source\r\n* Strictly typed\r\n* Syntax similar to JavaScript/ActionScript/Java\r\n* Expressive modern language\r\n\r\n````\r\nclass HelloWorld\r\n{\r\n\tstatic function main()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn new HelloWorld();\r\n\t}\r\n\tpublic function new()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\ttrace(\"Hello World !\");\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n````"}
